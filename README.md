# ZeroCam NightVision Security Camera
3d printed case for the ZeroCam NightVision

I remixed a model from Thingiverse to fit the original "ZeroCam NightVision".  
The final project is now live in my front yard as a security camera.  
Apart from fixing the holes and everything to fit the original camera instead of the chinese version that the original creator of the files had used, I've redesigned the mount completely to be more stable and also added ventilation holes on the back.  
Now the Pi Zero doesn't get nearly as hot as before!  
Download the files on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2908211), where you can also find the originals.
